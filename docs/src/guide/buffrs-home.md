## Buffrs Home

`$HOME/.buffrs`

The buffrs home directory is a place for global configuration and data
belonging to buffrs such as credentials and a cache. You should not need to
interact with this folder manually.

The home directory that is used by buffrs can be configured via the
`BUFFRS_HOME` environment variable. This enables you do override the default
location in case you want to keep your home directory clean.
